# Design-of-an-evaporator-for-a-buoyant-two-phases-flow-cooling-loop-of-a-telecommunication-satellite
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Satellites are constituted of electronic components that release heat flux. The heat released must be evacuated otherwise there are some risks to damage components in the satellite. In order to guarantee the correct working of the satellite, a thermal loop crossed by a refrigerant fluid must be added. The loop is constituted by a heater, a pressure regulator, a condenser, and a pump. The evaporator is the element of the loop in which the heat released by the electronic components is transferred to the fluid. The fluid, receiver of the components entailed energy will then be heated and will evaporate itself little by little. This breeds the appearance of a two phase flow. The aim of this study is to take back the project realized last year in BEI and to improve it in order to adapt it to a better defined geometry, and to take into account the gravity for upward and descending flows in the pipes. A program, developed with the MATLAB code will take into account the different models of two phase flow that we can consider in our case. We will then be able to follow the evolution of the physical variables which characterize the system like the component temperature, the drop loss, void fraction and the quality. So, this study will provide a visualization of the thermo-hydraulics phenomenon in the evaporator, in the domain of specifications.</p>


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The code being implemented in Fortran 90, and Fortran being a compiled language, it requires a compiler such as <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran">GFortran</a>.

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install GFortran like this:

    sudo apt-get install gfortran
    
Alongside the GFortran compiler, the open-source platform for data analysis and visualization, <a href="https://www.paraview.org/">ParaView</a>, is also required and installed through the commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install paraview

For other Linux flavors, OS X and Windows, packages are available at:

https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries for GFortran    
https://www.paraview.org/download/ for ParaView


## File descriptions

* '.f90' files in which the main code, as well as the different subroutines are programmed.
* 'physical_data.txt' which contains the different parameters to define the domain of computation, mesh size, and other parameters such as CFL or Fourier numbers.
* In the output directory 'ex_output_files', there are four files:     
-> 2 output *.vts files atÂ t=0 et Tf/2    
-> 2 output *.txt files of velocity profile in x=1 for different data 

* 4 animations in the 'animations' directory.

### Running the program

1. Input numerical values in the file physical_data.txt

        80            ! n  number of mesh cells in y    
        70            ! m  number of mesh cells in x    
        5             ! Length L1 of the domain    
        2             ! Height L2 (Left side of the domain)    
        2             ! Height L3 (Right side of the domain)     
        0.01          ! Diffusion coefficient    
        0             ! Velocity U (x direction)     
        0             ! Velocity V (y direction)          
        5             ! Final time    
        0.9           ! CFL number    
        0.4           ! Fourier number    

    Modifying and tuning these values in order to have an orthogonal mesh or not, diffusion and/or advection...

2. Use the **Makefile** to compile all the files and create the executable (run the command 'make' while being in the main directory of the program).

3. Launch the executable , which will create the mesh and run the discretised calculation on the latter.

4. Observe the concentration field on the domain using Paraview (open sol.pvd).

5. Remove the created files thanks to the commands 'make clean' and 'make solclean'.
